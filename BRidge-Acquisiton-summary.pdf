**BRidge + Futures.com**  
*Liquidity infrastructure for physical commodities*

---

### What It Is
BRidge is a turnkey software platform that transforms real-world inventory into hedgeable, digital contracts. It enables material originators like scrap yards to participate in financial markets—securely, compliantly, and profitably.

---

### Why It Matters
- $50B+ in annual U.S. scrap volume  
- 99% of yards have no digital market access  
- No standardized infrastructure for physical-to-digital contracts  
- Early positioning = control of an untapped asset class

---

### What’s Included
- Fully developed software (frontend, backend, contract engine, WebSocket)  
- Sandbox-ready infrastructure (Dockerized)  
- Regulatory-ready contract structure (single + mixed load logic)  
- Branding + premium domain: **Futures.com**  
- Pitch deck, spec sheets, and revenue models included

---

### Ideal For
- Institutional desks (Schwab, CME, ICE, Citadel)  
- Commodity platforms  
- Brokerages expanding into physical finance  
- Strategic acquirers seeking first-mover digital commodity tools

---

### Call to Action
**Available for full acquisition.**  
Optional support available from founding team.
