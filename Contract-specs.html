        <strong>TAS/TAM Rules:</strong><br>
        Trading at Settlement (TAS) is subject to Rule 524.A. TAS trades off a “Base Price” of zero (equal to the daily settlement price) to create a differential versus the daily settlement price of the underlying futures contract month. The TAS clearing price equals the daily settlement price plus or minus the TAS transaction price.<br>
        Trading at Marker (TAM) works similarly, using a marker price rather than the settlement price to establish the differential.
