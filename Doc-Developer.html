Developer Documentation
Project Overview
The BRidge Build is developed as an interactive web dashboard built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is structured to provide a robust user interface along with flexible, modular code that facilitates easy updates and scalability.

Repository Structure
Below is an example of the repository layout:

bash
Copy
HTMLs/
└── bridge-dashboard/
    ├── index.html          # Main entry point for the dashboard
    ├── css/                # CSS files and styling assets
    ├── js/                 # JavaScript files, including main application logic and modules
    ├── assets/             # Images, fonts, and other static resources
    ├── config/             # Configuration files (e.g., API endpoints, environment settings)
    └── docs/               # Documentation and support files
Feel free to adjust folder names or add further details as required.

Development Environment Setup
Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (if the project uses Node-based tooling).

A modern web browser for testing and debugging.

A code editor such as VS Code or Sublime Text.

Installation:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/tb454/HTMLs.git
cd HTMLs/bridge-dashboard
Install any required dependencies (if applicable):

bash
Copy
npm install
Running the Application Locally:

For a static build, simply open index.html in your browser.

If a development server is used:

bash
Copy
npm start
Access the local server at [http://localhost:3000] (or your designated port).

Code Structure and Conventions
Modular JavaScript:
The code is divided into modules to enhance maintainability. Common functions and utilities are kept in separate files.

Naming Conventions:

Variables and function names follow camelCase.

CSS classes use kebab-case.

HTML elements have clear, descriptive IDs and classes.

Comments & Documentation:
Inline comments are used to explain non-trivial logic. Detailed documentation for functions and modules can be found in the /docs folder.

Contribution Guidelines
Branching Strategy:

Main Branch: Stable, production-ready code.

Feature Branches: For new features, bug fixes, or improvements. Please create a branch with a descriptive name (e.g., feature/new-chart-module).

Coding Standards:

Follow the provided style guides for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Write tests where applicable.

Pull Requests:

Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes.

Ensure all tests pass before merging.

Issue Tracking:

Report bugs or request features using GitHub Issues.

Follow the issue template to ensure all necessary details are provided.

Build and Deployment
Build Process:

Use the provided build scripts to minify and bundle assets:

bash
Copy
npm run build
Output files are typically placed in a dist/ or build/ folder.

Deployment:

For web hosting, deploy the contents of the build folder to your preferred server or cloud service (e.g., AWS S3, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).

Ensure that the configuration files point to production API endpoints and resources.

Testing and Debugging
Unit Testing:

Tests are written using [Jest/Mocha] (or your preferred framework). Run tests with:

bash
Copy
npm test
Debugging:

Use browser developer tools for inspecting HTML/CSS and debugging JavaScript.

Check console logs for error messages during development.

Continuous Integration:

Configure CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) to run tests automatically on pull requests.

Additional Resources
Documentation:
Detailed technical documentation is maintained in the /docs folder.

API Documentation:
If the dashboard integrates with APIs, include an API documentation file (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI spec).
