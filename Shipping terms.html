each month and may be applicable for (a) the entire month; (b) the remainder of that
particular month; (c) for a given period of time to be specified; or, (d) for a specific

completed within a specific period of time, generally for one calendar month.
Balances on any P.O. not shipped by the specified completion date may be cancelled
or extended at the discretion of the CMC Steel Florida Raw Materials Department.
(All prices are quoted in Gross Tons and all quantities expressed on a P.O. are in
Gross Tons.)

quantities (at agreed upon minimum weights) as specified at the time of purchase.

E. RECEIVING AND GRADING – CMC Steel Florida’s weights and grading will govern
final settlement for all raw materials purchases. A current CMC Steel Florida

materials representative and must be referenced on all correspondence and
shipping documents.

2. In the case of truck delivery, the driver must provide the Scale Operator with:
a. Purchase order number
b. Yard of origin
c. Grade being delivered
d. Bill of Lading
3. In the case of rail shipment, the shipper must notify CMC Steel Florida’s Raw
materials Department prior to the arrival of the car at CMC Steel Florida.
4. We will not accept rail shipments without complete prior notification. Shipments
without prior notice may be returned to origin at the supplier’s expense or supplier
may be responsible for demurrage charges incurred while the car’s origin is being
determined. In the event a shipment is received without prior notification and is
unloaded, for whatever reason, CMC Steel Florida’s grading will govern
settlement.
5. The Scale Administrator will note the grade (i.e. shredded, #2HMS, etc.) on the
scale ticket. The Scale Administrator will notify a Scrap Inspector, Scrap Yard
Supervisor, Melt Shop Manager who will then notify the Raw Materials
Department of any substandard raw materials shipment. The shipper will then be
notified by the Raw materials Department and the material will be held for
downgrading upon supplier’s acceptance or rejected at the sole discretion of CMC
Steel Florida. In all cases, shipments held for disposition (downgrade/radiation)
must be cleared within (24) hours except weekends or holidays, with any
detention, demurrage, or other charges being the sole responsibility of the
supplier.
6. After a shipment is weighed in, it will be the responsibility of the raw materials
inspector and the crane operator on duty to inspect the remainder of the shipment
and determine whether it meets the quality standards as set forth in CMC Steel
Florida’s RAW MATERIALS SPECIFICATION MANUAL.

7. Disputes over substandard material, contracts, grading, unloading, etc., on raw
materials delivered after normal business hours (8:00am to 5:00pm, Monday
through Friday) will be handled during the next day’s normal business hours, and
the shipment will not be unloaded, or if unloading has begun, will not be completed
until the appropriate personnel have been contacted and have had an opportunity
to inspect the load during normal daylight hours and come to a decision regarding
acceptability.
8. Rejected truckloads or carloads of raw materials become the supplier’s
responsibility at the time of notification. The Raw materials Department will make
every effort to assist the supplier and minimize the negative effects of a problem
shipment.
9. All freight charges or demurrage charges for a rejected shipment are the
responsibility of the shipper, and will either be billed to the shipper, or deducted
from a current or future shipment.

F. TRUCK UNLOADING will be accomplished as carefully as possible with respect to
the driver’s safety and care of his truck and trailer and surrounding people and
property.

G. SAFETY is paramount at CMC Steel Florida. Only the driver will be allowed into the
raw materials storage area. Drivers will be trained to our Critical Driver Safety Rules
for Melt Shop Scrap Area and DAMAGE Waiver. Drivers are always to follow Safety
Rules.

H. PAYMENTS are made by check or ACH and are issued promptly per the payment
terms agreed to and noted on the P.O. Please do not send invoices to CMC Accounts
Payable Shared Services as we pay based on CMC’s receiving weight tickets. During
the end of month closing periods, there could be a slight delay in issuing checks.
