    <h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <h2>A. Purchasing of Raw Materials</h2>
    <p>
      Purchasing of raw materials is handled by the Raw Materials Department.
      The department may be contacted at <strong>803.936.3801</strong> or 
      <strong>803.936.3804</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>B. Prices</h2>
    <p>
      Prices are quoted for each raw material commodity primarily at the beginning 
      of each month and may be applicable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) the entire month;</li>
      <li>(b) the remainder of that particular month;</li>
      <li>(c) a given period of time to be specified; or</li>
      <li>(d) for a specific quantity to be delivered by a specific date.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A purchase contract with a corresponding purchase order number (P.O.) will be issued 
      for specific grades and quantities to be completed within a specific period of time, generally for one calendar month.
      Balances on any P.O. not shipped by the specified completion date may be cancelled or extended at the discretion 
      of the CMC Steel Florida Raw Materials Department.
      <span class="note">(All prices are quoted in Gross Tons and all quantities on a P.O. are in Gross Tons.)</span>
    </p>

    <h2>C. Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      Delivery may be made in truckload (at agreed upon minimum weights) or carload quantities 
      (at agreed upon minimum weights) as specified at the time of purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>D. Scale House Hours</h2>
    <p>
      Please contact the Raw Materials Department for current scale hours.
    </p>

    <h2>E. Receiving and Grading</h2>
    <p>
      CMC Steel Florida’s weights and grading will govern final settlement for all raw materials purchases.
      A current CMC Steel Florida purchase order must be on file for each shipment.
      No raw materials will be received at the scale unless:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A purchase order number has been issued to the supplier by an authorized Raw Materials representative and 
        must be referenced on all correspondence and shipping documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the case of truck delivery, the driver must provide the Scale Operator with:
        <ul>
          <li>Purchase order number</li>
          <li>Yard of origin</li>
          <li>Grade being delivered</li>
          <li>Bill of Lading</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the case of rail shipment, the shipper must notify CMC Steel Florida’s Raw Materials Department 
        prior to the arrival of the car.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will not accept rail shipments without complete prior notification. Shipments without prior notice may be 
        returned to origin at the supplier’s expense or the supplier may be responsible for demurrage charges incurred 
        while the car’s origin is determined. In the event a shipment is received without prior notification and is unloaded, 
        CMC Steel Florida’s grading will govern settlement.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Scale Administrator will note the grade (e.g., shredded, #2HMS, etc.) on the scale ticket.
        The Scale Administrator will notify a Scrap Inspector, Scrap Yard Supervisor, and Melt Shop Manager, who will then notify the 
        Raw Materials Department of any substandard raw materials shipment. The shipper will be notified by the Raw Materials Department, 
        and the material will be held for downgrading upon the supplier’s acceptance or rejected at the sole discretion of CMC Steel Florida.
        In all cases, shipments held for disposition (downgrade/radiation) must be cleared within 24 hours (except weekends or holidays), 
        with any detention, demurrage, or other charges being the supplier’s responsibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a shipment is weighed in, it is the responsibility of the raw materials inspector and the crane operator on duty 
        to inspect the remainder of the shipment and determine whether it meets the quality standards as set forth in the 
        CMC Steel Florida RAW MATERIALS SPECIFICATION MANUAL.
      </li>
      <li>
        Disputes over substandard material, contracts, grading, unloading, etc., on raw materials delivered after normal business hours 
        (8:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday) will be handled during the next day’s normal business hours. The shipment will not be 
        unloaded—or, if unloading has begun, will not be completed—until the appropriate personnel have been contacted, inspected the load 
        during normal daylight hours, and reached a decision regarding acceptability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejected truckloads or carloads of raw materials become the supplier’s responsibility at the time of notification.
        The Raw Materials Department will make every effort to assist the supplier and minimize the negative effects of a problem shipment.
      </li>
      <li>
        All freight charges or demurrage charges for a rejected shipment are the responsibility of the shipper, and will either be billed 
        to the shipper or deducted from a current or future shipment.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>F. Truck Unloading</h2>
    <p>
      Truck unloading will be accomplished as carefully as possible with respect to the driver’s safety, care of his truck and trailer, 
      and protection of surrounding people and property.
    </p>

    <h2>G. Safety</h2>
    <p>
      Safety is paramount at CMC Steel Florida. Only the driver will be allowed into the raw materials storage area. Drivers will be trained 
      on our Critical Driver Safety Rules for the Melt Shop Scrap Area and DAMAGE Waiver. Drivers must always follow Safety Rules.
    </p>

    <h2>H. Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are made by check or ACH and are issued promptly per the payment terms noted on the P.O.
      Please do not send invoices to CMC Accounts Payable Shared Services as we pay based on CMC’s receiving weight tickets.
      During the end-of-month closing periods, there may be a slight delay in issuing checks.
