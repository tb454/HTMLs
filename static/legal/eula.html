    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Reservation of Rights</h3>
    <p>BRidge is licensed, not sold. Atlas and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted.</p>

    <!-- NEW: Regulatory Status -->
    <h3>2.3 Regulatory Status; No Brokerage</h3>
    <p>Unless expressly stated in an Order, Atlas is not acting as a registered broker-dealer, investment adviser, alternative trading system (ATS), designated contract market (DCM), or clearing agency. BRidge is software infrastructure and operational tooling; it does not constitute investment advice, a solicitation to buy or sell commodities or securities, or a commitment to execute or clear any transaction.</p>

    <h2 id="3-accounts-access"><span class="section-id">3.</span>Accounts, Access &amp; Roles</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for: (a) creating and maintaining accurate account information; (b) restricting access to authorized Users; (c) all activities under your accounts; and (d) complying with role-based permissions (e.g., admin, buyer, seller, manager).</p>
    <p>Atlas may suspend or restrict access (e.g., via kill-switch or entitlements) to protect the platform, enforce risk controls, address non-payment, or respond to regulatory issues.</p>

    <h2 id="4-acceptable-use"><span class="section-id">4.</span>Acceptable Use; Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <!-- NEW: API Fair Use -->
    <h3>4.1 API Fair Use &amp; Rate Limits</h3>
    <p>You will comply with published or in-product rate limits and idempotency requirements. Atlas may throttle, queue, or temporarily block requests that exceed fair-use thresholds or threaten system stability.</p>

    <h2 id="5-data-rights-privacy"><span class="section-id">5.</span>Data Rights, Confidentiality &amp; Privacy</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Customer Data</h3>
    <p>You retain all rights to Customer Data. You grant Atlas a worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, process, display, analyze, and create Derived Data from Customer Data to provide, secure, and improve BRidge (including indices, risk models, anomaly detection, and operational analytics).</p>

    <h3>5.2 Derived Data</h3>
    <p>Atlas owns Derived Data and may use it for benchmarking, indices, product improvement, security, and compliance, provided it is not used to identify you or your Users (unless legally required or expressly permitted by you).</p>

    <h3>5.3 Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>Each party will protect the other’s Confidential Information with reasonable care and use it only as permitted under this EULA. Confidentiality obligations survive termination.</p>

    <p>Atlas may use vetted subprocessors (e.g., hosting, storage, observability) to provide BRidge. A current list is available upon request and may be updated. Where a DPA applies, data residency, transfer mechanisms, and subprocessors will follow the DPA’s terms and prevail over this EULA in case of conflict.</p>

    <h2 id="6-compliance"><span class="section-id">6.</span>Compliance (KYC/AML/Sanctions; Recordkeeping)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for your own counterparty diligence. BRidge supports flags and statuses, but does not certify counterparties.</li>
      <li>You must not use BRidge in violation of KYC/AML, sanctions, or import/export laws. Atlas may suspend access upon reasonable suspicion of noncompliance.</li>
      <li>Recordkeeping, retention, and export (e.g., <code>/admin/exports</code>) are provided as tools; you remain responsible for regulatory filings and accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="7-third-party"><span class="section-id">7.</span>Third-Party Services, Market Data &amp; APIs</h2>
    <p>BRidge may rely on third-party services (e.g., ICE Digital Trade, Supabase, cloud storage, FX references) and may ingest/delay reference Market Data (e.g., COMEX/LME snapshots) on a best-effort basis.

Atlas makes no guarantees regarding availability, accuracy, timeliness, licensing status, or continuing access to third-party services or Market Data.</p>

      <li>BRidge may generate immutable (hash-chained) audit events and daily seals. You consent to logging and monitoring necessary to provide and secure the Service.</li>
      <li>Disaster recovery targets (e.g., RTO/RPO) are goals and not guarantees.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Audit Rights.</strong> Atlas may grant limited audit access to regulators, licensed exchanges, or their designated auditors for the sole purpose of verifying compliance, provided such access is subject to confidentiality and security controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Atlas may update, modify, or discontinue features (including indices, APIs, or integrations) on reasonable notice where practicable. BRidge is provided on an “as-available” basis; no specific uptime or response SLAs are provided unless expressly stated in an Order or SLA addendum.</p>
    <p><strong>Service Level Addendum.</strong> Service uptime and performance commitments, where applicable, are defined in the <em>SLA Addendum</em> available upon request or as incorporated by reference in an Order.</p>

    <!-- NEW: Open-Source & Third-Party Components -->
    <h3>11.1 Third-Party &amp; Open-Source Components</h3>
    <p>BRidge may include or interact with open-source software and third-party components subject to their own licenses. To the extent required by those licenses, Atlas will make applicable notices and source code offers available upon request. In the event of conflict between such licenses and this EULA, the open-source licenses control solely for the covered components.</p>

    <h2 id="17-governing-law"><span class="section-id">17.</span>Governing Law, Venue &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.</p>
    <p><strong>International / UK Users.</strong> Where the Order specifies the United Kingdom as the contracting region, or where you are incorporated or primarily located in the UK, this EULA is governed by the laws of England and Wales. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales for matters not subject to arbitration under this Section.</p>

    <h3>17.1 Dispute Escalation Ladder</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mediation (Good-Faith Negotiation).</strong> The parties’ authorized representatives will meet (virtually or in person) to negotiate in good faith for at least ten (10) business days to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this EULA.</li>
      <li><strong>Arbitration.</strong> If the dispute is not resolved by mediation, it will be finally resolved by binding arbitration:
        <ul>
          <li><em>US seat:</em> American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules, seated in Indianapolis, Indiana, before one arbitrator.</li>
          <li><em>UK seat:</em> London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) Rules, seated in London, England, before one arbitrator.</li>
        </ul>
        Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

      <li><strong>Litigation (Residual Matters).</strong> Applications for injunctive relief, enforcement of arbitration awards, or claims not subject to arbitration by law may be brought in the courts specified above.</li>

    <h2 id="18-updates"><span class="section-id">18.</span>Updates to this EULA</h2>
    <p>Atlas may update this EULA to reflect changes to the Service, law, or business needs. Material changes will be posted within BRidge (e.g., at <code>/eula</code>) and become effective upon posting or as otherwise stated. Your continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2 id="19-general"><span class="section-id">19.</span>General Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This EULA, the Policies, and any applicable Order constitute the entire agreement and supersede prior discussions.</li>
      <li><strong>Order of Precedence.</strong> If there is a conflict, an executed Order controls, then this EULA, then the Policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign this EULA without Atlas’s prior written consent; any attempted assignment in violation is void. Atlas may assign to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, sale, or reorganization.</li>
      <li><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party is liable for delays beyond its reasonable control (e.g., acts of God, network failures, regulatory actions).</li>
      <li><strong>Severability; Waiver.</strong> If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. Failure to enforce is not a waiver.</li>
      <li><strong>Independent Contractors.</strong> The parties are independent contractors; no partnership, agency, or fiduciary duty is created.</li>
