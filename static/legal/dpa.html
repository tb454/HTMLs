  <h1>Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)</h1>
  <p class="muted">This DPA forms part of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="/eula">EULA</a> between Atlas IP Holdings LLC (“<strong>Atlas</strong>”) and the customer (“<strong>Customer</strong>”). It governs Atlas’s processing of personal data subject to GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and comparable privacy laws.</p>

  <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Applicable Law:</strong> the EU GDPR (2016/679), UK GDPR, UK Data Protection Act 2018, CCPA/CPRA, and successor legislation.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Data:</strong> personal data processed by Atlas on behalf of Customer through BRidge.</li>
    <li><strong>Subprocessor:</strong> any third party engaged by Atlas to process Customer Data on its behalf (see <a href="/legal/subprocessors">list</a>).</li>
    <li><strong>SCCs:</strong> EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses (2021/914) + UK Addendum (IDTA).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Roles of the Parties</h2>
  <p>Customer acts as <strong>Controller</strong>; Atlas acts as <strong>Processor</strong>. Where Atlas jointly determines purposes or means, the parties are joint controllers to the limited extent required by law.</p>

  <h2>3. Processing Instructions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Atlas processes Customer Data solely to provide, maintain, and improve BRidge; to act on documented instructions; and as required by law.</li>
    <li>Customer ensures its instructions comply with Applicable Law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Confidentiality &amp; Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authorized personnel are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
    <li>Atlas implements the technical and organizational measures described in the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/eula">EULA</a> (encryption, access control, logging, DR, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Security Incidents:</strong> Atlas will notify Customer <em>without undue delay</em> after becoming aware of a personal data breach affecting Customer Data and will provide information reasonably necessary for Customer to meet its obligations, subject to confidentiality and security constraints.</p>

  <h2>5. Subprocessing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Atlas may engage subprocessors listed at <a href="/legal/subprocessors">/legal/subprocessors</a>.</li>
    <li>Atlas will notify Customer of new subprocessors and allow 30 days to object on reasonable, documented grounds related to data protection.</li>
    <li>All subprocessors are bound by written agreements imposing equivalent data protection obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Transfers outside the EEA/UK rely on SCCs (2021/914) and the UK Addendum (IDTA).</li>
    <li>Atlas implements supplementary measures where required by regulators.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Docking Clause:</strong> If the SCCs are updated or replaced, the parties will execute the then-current version and take reasonable steps to maintain a valid transfer mechanism.</p>

  <h2>7. Assistance to Customer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Atlas assists with data-subject requests, DPIAs, and consultations with authorities, considering processing nature and available information.</li>
    <li>Atlas provides reasonable documentation of security controls upon written request.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Government Requests:</strong> Where legally permitted, Atlas will promptly notify Customer of any authority request for Customer Data and will challenge unlawful or over-broad demands.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Subject Requests</h2>
  <p>When Atlas receives a request directly, it will redirect the requester to Customer unless legally prohibited. Customer remains responsible for responses.</p>

  <h2>9. Audit Rights</h2>
  <p>Atlas provides audit reports (SOC 2, penetration tests, or similar) upon request and, where necessary, allows on-site audits no more than <strong>once per 12 months</strong> (unless required by a supervisory authority or following a confirmed incident) during business hours, subject to confidentiality. Audits are at Customer’s expense and must not unreasonably disrupt Atlas operations.</p>

  <h2>10. Return or Deletion</h2>
  <p>Upon termination or written request, Atlas will delete or return Customer Data within 30 days unless law requires retention. Residual backup data will be overwritten per retention cycles.</p>
  <p>Upon written request, Atlas will provide <strong>deletion certification</strong> consistent with standard backup schedules.</p>

  <h2>11. Liability &amp; Indemnity</h2>
  <p>Liability under this DPA follows the limitations in the master agreement (Terms/EULA). Neither party limits liability where prohibited by law.</p>

  <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This DPA prevails over conflicting provisions of the Terms/EULA concerning data protection.</li>
    <li>Governed by the law and jurisdiction specified in the master agreement (Indiana / England &amp; Wales for UK customers).</li>
    <li>Executed electronically; acceptance of the Terms constitutes acceptance of this DPA.</li>
  </ul>
